# MERMS - Disease Monitoring and Control System

MERMS is a robust digital disease monitoring and control system designed to facilitate rapid reporting, AI-driven anomaly detection, and coordinated epidemic response across civilians, healthcare institutions, public health organizations, and national emergency operations centers.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** [Hono](https://hono.dev/) (Running on Node.js Adapter)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database / Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL + GoTrue Auth)
- **Validation:** Zod

## 👥 User Roles

The system is built around a role-based architecture with four primary user types:
1. **Civilian (Level 0):** Residents who receive hyper-local zone alerts and national health trends.
2. **Institution (Level 1):** Hospitals, clinics, and labs that submit "Sentinel Reports" of patient clusters and symptoms.
3. **Public Health Officer / PHO (Level 2):** Zone-level officials who investigate AI-flagged alerts, verify outbreaks, and broadcast warnings.
4. **Emergency Operations Center / EOC (Level 3):** Top-level administrators who oversee the entire system, manage facilities, assign PHOs, and coordinate national response protocols.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### 2. Environment Variables
Navigate to the `backend/` directory and configure your environment variables:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and fill in your Supabase connection details:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `PORT` (Default: 3000)

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Database Schema Setup
To get the database up and running, you need to apply the schema to your Supabase project:
1. Copy the contents of the `schema.sql` file located in the root directory.
2. Go to your Supabase Project Dashboard -> **SQL Editor** -> **New Query**.
3. Paste the SQL code and hit **Run**.

This query will create the `profiles`, `facilities`, `ai_alerts`, `sentinel_reports`, and `response_protocols` tables, along with an automatic trigger that synchronizes new authentication users into the `profiles` table.

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Build for Production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **Start Production Server:**
  ```bash
  npm start
