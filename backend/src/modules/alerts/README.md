# Alerts Module
Manages the AI Alerts Lifecycle, Civilian and National Feeds.

## Purpose
Delivers categorized alerts generated by the AI to Public Health Officials (PHO) to investigate and validate. It also controls broadcasting public advisories to civilians based on localization or aggregated national trends.

## Architecture
- `alerts.repository.ts`: Database connection dealing with `ai_alerts` table (status updates, fetching inboxes, claiming logic).
- `alerts.service.ts`: Defines valid state transitions and orchestrates data aggregation for national feeds. Handles broadcasting logic stub.
- `alerts.controller.ts`: Connects routes to specific roles (`pho`, `civilian`), resolving parameters, query strings, and auth users before calling the Service layer.
- `index.ts`: Combines internal parts and maps endpoints to the main API.
- `__tests__/alerts.test.ts`: Ensures safe status modifications, appropriate error catching, and secure claim rules logic.
